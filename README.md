# [Website](https://ergometer-space.org/)

# Browser compatibility

* Chrome
  - The only browser which I have really tested.
  - On unix and mac it should be possible to connect to a PM5 using web bluetooth
* Firefox
* Internet explorer
  - Web sockets to other domains are by default not allowed. You need to add the website to the local intranet websites to make it work.
* Safari

Apart from the usefull functionality is the website also a test bed for new web technologies.
